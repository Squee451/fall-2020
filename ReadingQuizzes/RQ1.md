# Reading Quiz 1

1. Explain what identification means, according to Arthur Lewbel

Identifcation asks, if we that population that data are drawn from would X be known, if not what could be learned about X. 

2. Correctly order the following econometric actions in their logical sequence:
    - estimation
    - identification
    - hypothesis testing
    - inference

3. What are the two characteristics of reduced-form causal methods, according to Lewbel? How is this different from structural methods?

Causal methods focus on identification and estimation on treatment effects. They are usually based on randomization  and forego attempts
to identify structural parameters representing the behavior of economic agents. 

4. What does Lewbel refer to as "crude structural modeling"?

Speculation on the causal link between household power and health to explain the excess mortality rate for women in the Calvi study. 

5. What does Lewbel suggest is a way to overcome the external validity problem?
Using economic theory and structures can provide guidance in the external validity of causal parameters. For example in RDD using 
Local policy invariance one can identify how treatment effects estimated by RDD would change if the threshold were raised or lowered even when no such change in
the threshold is observed.
